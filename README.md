# ebraille
Repository for developing use cases and possibly a standard  for digital braille

The main objectives for the next phase of the project are:
* Develop a problem statement for developing a common understanding for what problem do we want to solve.
* Develop use cases.
* Identify the most important use cases and determine the scope.
* Analyze if these use cases can be addressed by an existing standard or by extending an existing standard, or do we need to develop a completely new standard.
