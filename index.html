			<p>This specification defines eBraille, a digital reading format for braille publications.</p>

			<div data-include="common/status.html" data-include-replace="true"></div>
			<p>The eBraille Working Group is seeking input on all aspects of this document. It is particularly
				interested in implementation experience both creating eBraille publication and creating reading systems
				in which to read them.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="intro">
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<section id="overview">
				<h3>Overview</h3>

				<p>Unlike braille formats that focus on interchanging embosser-ready braille, eBraille focuses on
					adapting braille for reading in refreshable braille displays with different line lengths.</p>

				<p>In order to maintain close alignment with mainstream publishing formats, and simplify transcription
					of these works, the eBraille format is built on an EPUB 3-compatible file set &#8212; it
					incorporates XHTML documents, CSS, images, audio, and video. This means that an [=ebraille
					publication=] shares its technology with the web, making it compatible for reading in standard web
					browsers.</p>

				<p>An [=eBraille publication=] differs from reading a typical web site in that the braille is not
					transformed on the fly but comes formatted according to the rules of the regional braille code where
					the publication was produced. But users are not locked into the default display. With the display
					flexibility of CSS, and standardized markup practices, they could apply styles for another region or
					even modify the display to their own preferences (e.g., by changing the maximum line length).</p>

				<p>eBraille publications are also designed to be flexible for deployment. An eBraille publication can be
					placed on the web, unzipped on a user's local file system, or distributed in EPUB 3-compatible
					packaging. And as web-compatible file sets, they are adaptable to future changes to publishing
					formats.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="relationship-epub3" class="informative">
				<h3>Relationship to EPUB 3</h3>

				<p>The [=eBraille file set=] is designed to be compatible with EPUB 3 [[epub-33]] and adapt to changes
					to that standard. Distribution and consumption on mainstream [=EPUB reading systems=], however, is
					not a primary goal of this format. This specification introduces some additional requirements and
					features beyond those defined in EPUB 3, and it is not expected that mainstream reading systems will
					adapt to these modifications. Consequently, an eBraille publication may not render exactly as
					intended outside of eBraille reading systems.</p>

				<p>The primary difference between the eBraille format and EPUB 3 is eBraille publications do not have to
					be packaged and distributed in an [=EPUB container=] [[epub-33]]. An [=eBraille publication=] will
					be easy to package in an EPUB container when needed, however.</p>

				<p>Compatibility with EPUB 3 also means that eBraille relies on the same <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-intro-relations">underlying technologies</a> [[epub-33]]. Many of these
					technologies, like [[html]], are referred to as "evergreen" or "living" standards as they are
					updated often and they do not have version numbers. Others, like [[svg]], are referred to without a
					specific version number so that the latest recommendation is always the recommended one to use.</p>

				<p>The practical effect of this approach is predominantly beneficial for [=eBraille creators=]. New
					features become available for use as soon as they are standardized, without having to wait for the
					eBraille standard to catch up. It does come with some drawbacks, however. eBraille creators also
					have to keep themselves apprised of changes to the underlying technologies, and use their best
					judgement in some cases as to whether a new feature is supported well enough in [=eBraille reading
					systems=] to begin deploying. In some rare cases, it may also mean that content that was previously
					valid may no longer be, but breaking changes like this usually only happen when features are
					unsupported or are found to have serious security or privacy flaws.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="future-dir" class="informative">
				<h3>Future directions</h3>

				<p>The first version of the eBraille format is focused on creating a reading experience that is
					minimally feature complete for the majority of braille publications. It is not expected that this
					version will handle every unique formatting requirement of every publication type, but future drafts
					and versions of this specification will focus on making the format more feature complete.</p>

				<p>In particular, the working group expects to review the current support decisions for the following
					features:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>scripting &#8212; the use of JavaScript in [=eBraille content documents=] is currently
						prohibited. The working group is seeking further input on the need for dynamic braille before
						allowing scripting as the ability to script documents increases the security and privacy risks
						of the format.</li>
					<li>CSS extensions &#8212; the first version of eBraille uses standard CSS properties to format
						braille content. There may be a need to extend CSS in the future to handle more complex
						formatting cases, which will also require defining reading system implementations.</li>
				</ul>

		</section>
		<section id="ebrl-resources">
			<h2>Publication resources</h2>

			<section id="res-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>An [=eBraille publication=] is typically composed of many resources &#8212; XHTML documents, CSS
					files, tactile graphics, audio, video, etc.</p>

				<p>As an eBraille publication is intended to be easily packaged as a conforming [=EPUB publication=],
					the requirements for publication resources are inherited from EPUB, specifically as defined in <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-publication-resources"></a> [[epub-33]].</p>

				<p>This section represents a subsetting of the EPUB requirements, as certain features, such as manifest
					fallbacks, are disallowed in eBraille publications.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="cmt">
				<h3>Core media types</h3>

				<p>To ensure that [=eBraille reading systems=] are capable of rendering the content of [=eBraille
					publications=], only certain widely supported resource types are allowed to be included without
					fallbacks. These are called core media types and are designated by their MIME media type [[rfc2046]]
					(e.g., XHTML documents have the MIME media type <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>.</p>

				<p>Being designated a core media type does not mean that all reading systems are required to support the
					type of resource, however. A reading system without audio capabilities will not be able to render
					audio core media types, for example.</p>

				<p>The list of core media types allowed in eBraille publications is the same as those designated for
					EPUB 3. Some of the key core media types for eBraille include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><code>application/xhtml+xml</code> &#8212; HTML documents that use the XML syntax [[html]].</li>
					<li><code>text/css</code> &#8212; CSS Style Sheets [[css2]].</li>
					<li><code>image/jpeg</code> &#8212; JPEG Images [[jpeg]]</li>
					<li><code>image/png</code> &#8212; PNG Images [[png]]</li>
					<li><code>image/svg+xml</code> &#8212; SVG images [[svg]]</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The complete list is available in the <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-core-media-types">core media types
						section</a> of [[epub-33]].</p>

				<p>All other media types are considered <a href="foreign-res">foreign resources</a>.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="foreign-res">
				<h3>Foreign resources</h3>

				<p>Foreign resources, unlike <a href="#cmt">core media types</a>, have no guarantee of support in
					reading systems.</p>

				<p>To avoid users not being able to access the content of the [=eBraille publication=], foreign
					resources can only be used if a fallback to a core media type is provided. Fallbacks are provided
					using <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-intrinsic-fallbacks">intrinsic fallback methods</a> [[epub-33]].</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p><a href="#fallbacks">Manifest fallbacks</a> are not supported in eBraille, so foreign resources
						cannot be used in the <a href="#spine">spine</a>. Similarly, foreign image formats have to
						include fallbacks using the [[html]] [^img^] and [^picture^] elements' intrinsic fallback
						capabilities.</p>
				</div>

				<p>It is generally best to avoid foreign resources unless absolutely necessary. PDF tactile graphics are
					an example of a foreign resource that may not be avoidable for some EPUB creators, but using the
					[[html]] [^object^] element's intrinsic fallback capabilities can avoid having to duplicate the
					image in a core media type format.</p>

				<aside class="example" title="PDF tactile image with fallback">
					<pre><code>&lt;object
     data="ebraille/images/clouds.pdf"
     type="application/pdf"
     height="250"
     width="100"
     aria-labelledby="alt">
   &lt;p id="alt">&lt;!-- alternative text -->&lt;/p>
&lt;/object></code></pre>
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section id="fallbacks">
				<h3>Resource fallbacks</h3>

				<p>[=eBraille publications=] only support [=XHTML content documents=] in the [=spine=] [[epub-33]].
					Consequently, the use of <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-manifest-fallbacks">manifest fallbacks</a>
					[[epub-33]] is not supported.</p>

				<p>The intrinsic fallback methods provided by [[html]] elements are supported.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="res-location">
				<h3>Resource location</h3>

				<p>[=eBraille publications=] do not support [=remote resources=] [[epub-33]]. All publication resources
					MUST be located in or below the [=root directory=], as defined in <a href="#fileset-structure"
					></a>.</p>

				<p>eBraille does not support the <code>file:</code> URL scheme [[rfc8089]] for referencing resources in
					an eBraille publication. Accessing files on the user's local file system presents too great a
					security risk.</p>

				<p>The <code>data:</code> URL scheme MAY be used to embed resources within [=eBraille content
					documents=] per the restrictions outlined in <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-data-urls">Data URLs</a>
					[[epub-33]].</p>
			</section>

			<section id="res-exemptions" class="informative">
				<h3>Exempt resources</h3>

				<p>Note that it is possible to include additional resources in an [=eBraille publication=] that are not
					part of the rendering of the content. EPUB 3 defines resources that are not used in the [=spine=] or
					embedded in [=xhtml content documents=] as exempt from the normal [=core media type resource=]
					restrictions [[epub-33]].</p>

				<p>This means, for example, that [=eBraille creators=] can embed pre-formatted braille in their
					publication in a format such as PDF or BRF. The resource would still be listed in the [=manifest=],
					but it would not be flagged as needing a fallback.</p>

				<p>It would not be possible to link to these resources from the eBraille publication, but the
					publication could note the presence of the resources and include instructions on how to access them
					(e.g., to open the publication with a ZIP tool and navigate to a specific directory).</p>
			</section>

			<section id="res-extensions" class="informative">
				<h3>File extensions</h3>

				<p>Reading systems typically do not rely on file extensions for rendering, so, with a couple of notable
					exceptions for the <a href="#ebrl-package-doc">package document</a> and <a href="#ebrl-nav">primary
						entry page</a>, eBraille does not require specific extensions for the resources in an [=eBraille
					publication=]. The media type declared in the manifest is used as a hint to the nature of each
					resource, but even that declaration is not reliable. Instead, reading systems typically leave
					inspection of resources and their rendering to their underlying browser core.</p>

				<p>The use of standard file extensions for resources should still be considered a best practice,
					however, as it avoids authoring confusion over the nature of resources.</p>

				<p>Some formats have more than one common extension. For example, XHTML documents can use either the
					extension <code>.html</code> or <code>.xhtml</code> and JPEG images can use either <code>.jpg</code>
					or <code>.jpeg</code>. In these cases, either extension is acceptable.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>This specification uses the <code>.html</code> extension in examples for [=eBraille content
						documents=] as it is more widely used and recognized than <code>.xhtml</code>, particularly for
						opening the primary entry page.</p>

					<p>The <code>.xhtml</code> extension may be useful if eBraille content documents are opened in a
						browser on a local file system (e.g., for testing), as this triggers some browsers to render the
						content using the correct XML parser. It has no effect on documents served over the web,
						however.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="xml-conformance">
				<h3>XML conformance</h3>

				<p>The requirements for XML-based media types [[rfc2046]] defined in <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-xml-constraints">XML conformance</a> [[epub-33]] also apply to [=eBraille
					publications=].</p>

				<p>The only difference is that eBraille publications only support UTF-8 [[unicode]]. UTF-16 MUST NOT be
					used to encode XML resources.</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section id="ebrl-fileset">
			<h2>eBraille file set</h2>

			<section id="fileset-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>The [=eBraille file set=] is like a physical manifestation of the <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-container-abstract">OCF abstract container</a> [[epub-33]]. EPUB 3 only
					defines its file set in the abstract because those files are expected to be zipped in the [=EPUB
					container=] [[epub-33]]; the standard is not concerned with the physical files before they are
					zipped or after they are unzipped. As a ZIP file does not have a true file system within it, the
					rules for file naming and placement can only be defined virtually.</p>

				<p>eBraille moves the rules for the OCF abstract container to the physical file set that exists before
					and after packaging in the EPUB container. This allows an [=eBraille publication=] to be independent
					of packaging, making it a format that can flexibly move between web deployment and end-user
					distribution.</p>

				<p>eBraille defines additional rules on the file structure in order to make it easier to read an
					eBraille publication on the web or from a local file system. In particular, it requires the [=EPUB
					navigation document=] [[epub-33]] be in the root of the file set and named <code>index.html</code>.
					These requirements do not conflict with being able to package an eBraille publication as a valid
					[=EPUB publication=] [[epub-33]], however.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="fileset-structure">
				<h3>File and directory structure</h3>

				<p>The [=eBraille file set=] MUST have a single common root directory &#8212; the [=publication root=]
					&#8212; for all the contents of the [=eBraille publication=].</p>

				<p>Unlike EPUB 3, the eBraille file set MUST NOT reference resources outside the publication root (i.e.,
					[=remote resources=] [[epub-33]] are not supported).</p>

				<p>The eBraille file set MUST contain the following files in the publication root:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-nav">EPUB navigation document</a> [[epub-33]]. This file MUST be
						named <code>index.html</code></li>
					<li>The <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-package-doc">EPUB package document</a> [[epub-33]]. This file MUST
						be named <code>package.opf</code></li>
				</ul>

				<p>There are no restrictions on where the rest of the eBraille publication content goes beyond the
					requirement in EPUB 3 that <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-container-file-and-dir-structure">publication
						resources are not allowed in a <code>META-INF</code> directory</a> [[epub-33]].</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>For simplicity of unzipping and accessing a publication on a user's local file system, [=eBraille
						creators=] are encouraged to place the rest of the publication in a subfolder (e.g., named
							"<code>ebraille</code>"). This will make the navigation document the first HTML file users
						encounter.</p>
				</div>
			</section>

			<section id="fileset-naming">
				<h3>File paths and file names</h3>

				<p>eBraille file paths and file names MUST adhere to the file naming restrictions specified in <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-container-filenames">section 4.2.3</a> of [[epub-33]].</p>
			</section>

			<section id="fileset-urls">
				<h3>URLs in the file set</h3>

				<p>Although the [=publication root=] establishes a common directory for all files in an [=eBraille
					publication=], depending on how the eBraille publication is deployed it could allow references to
					resolve outside of the publication root. For example, if an eBraille publication is deployed on the
					web, unless it assigned its own domain, a [=path-absolute-URL string=] [[url]] (i.e., a path that
					begins with a slash) could allow the publication to reach other resources on the server.</p>

				<p>For this reason, the eBraille file set MUST NOT include file references that use path-absolute-URL
					strings.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="multiple-renditions">
				<h3>Multiple renditions</h3>

				<p>An [=eBraille publication=] MAY contain multiple renditions of the content. The specifics of how this
					is done are defined in EPUB 3 Multiple-Rendition Publications 1.1 [[epub-multi-rend-11]].</p>

				<p>When including multiple renditions, only the <a data-cite="epub-multi-rend-11##container">default
						rendition</a> [[epub-multi-rend-11]] (i.e., one listed first in the <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-container-metainf-container.xml"><code>container.xml</code> file</a>
					[[epub-33]]) is subject to the <a href="#fileset-structure">file naming and location
						requirements</a> for the package document and primary entry page. The <a
						href="#xhtml-char-encoding">recommendation to use only 6- and 8-dot Unicode characters</a> also
					only applies to the default rendition.</p>

				<p>The default rendition MUST be a braille rendition (i.e., identified by a <a
						data-cite="epub-multi-rend-11#accessMode-attr"><code>rendition:accessMode</code> attribute</a>
					with the value "<code>tactile</code>" [[epub-multi-rend-11]]).</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>[[epub-multi-rend-11]] is only a W3C Working Group Note. The technology is not currently
						considered stable and should be used with appropriate caution.</p>

		<section id="ebrl-package-doc">
			<h2>Package Document</h2>

			<section id="package-doc-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>eBraille uses the EPUB 3 <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-package-doc">package document</a> [[epub-33]] to
					express information about an [=eBraille publication=].</p>

				<p>The package document contains three primary sections:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Metadata &#8212; the <a href="#metadata"><code>metadata</code> element</a> contains
						bibliographic and rendering information about an eBraille publication.</li>
					<li>Manifest &#8212; the <a href="#manifest"><code>manifest</code> element</a> contains a list of
						all the publication resources.</li>
					<li>Spine &#8212; the <a href="#spine"><code>spine</code></a> element contains the default ordering
						of eBraille content documents.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The primary difference of the eBraille package document is only in the metadata that is required and
					recommended. The eBraille implementation of the package document is also more limited in the
					features it allows &#8212; manifest fallbacks and legacy element are not allowed, for example.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="metadata">
				<h3>Metadata</h3>

				<p>The eBraille package document metadata MUST meet all the requirements for [[epub-33]] <a

				<p>In particular, EPUB requires that all eBraille publications include a unique identifier, the title of
					the publication, the language of the content, and the last modification date.</p>

				<p>[=eBraille publications=] additionally MUST include the following metadata:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>braille code</li>
					<li>braille grade</li>
					<li>language</li>
					<li>title</li>
				</ul>

				<p>eBraille publications SHOULD include the following metadata:</p>

				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>[=eBraille content documents=] define the markup and presentation of the content of an [=eBraille
					publication=]. An eBraille content document is encoded using <a data-cite="html#">XML syntax</a> of
					[[html]], also commonly known as XHTML, and is styled using CSS [[css2]].</p>

				<p>eBraille content documents are not only formatted text. For example, they may include tactile
					graphics, audio, and video. The primary difference between the features of an eBraille content
					document and a typical web page is that scripting and forms are not supported.</p>

				<p>Note that unlike EPUB 3, eBraille only supports XHTML in the [=spine=] of an eBraille publication.
					SVG images are not supported in the [=spine=] but can be embedded in XHTML documents.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="xhtml">
				<h3>XHTML</h3>

				<p>An [=eBraille content document=] MUST be an <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-xhtml">XHTML content
						document</a> as defined [[epub-33]] with additional constraints as defined in the following
					subsections.</p>

				<section id="xhtml-char-encoding">
					<h4>Character encoding</h4>

					<p>[=eBraille content documents=] are required to provide their text content in 6- or 8-dot braille
						characters. eBraille is not meant as a delivery format for ASCII braille or similar mappings to
						braille cells.</p>

					<p>For this reason, the text content of [=eBraille content documents=] SHOULD consist only of the
						following characters:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://www.unicode.org/charts/nameslist/c_2800.html">Braille Patterns</a>
							[[unicode]];</li>
						<li>[=ASCII whitespace=] [[infra]]</li>
						<li>NO-BREAK SPACE (U+00A0)</li>
						<li>SOFT HYPHEN (U+00AD)</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="note">
						<p>The zero width space character is not included in this list as eBraille creators are advised
							to use the [^wbr^] element [[html]] to indicate break opportunities within words.</p>
					</div>

					<p>This restriction only applies to the renderable text of an XHTML document as well as the
						attributes that could be rendered depending on the display capabilities of a device or user
						configuration settings, for example:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>the [^img/alt^] attribute [[html]] for images and image maps that cannot be displayed;</li>
						<li>the [^th/abbr^] attribute [[html]] for alternative table headings;</li>
						<li>the [^abbr/title^] attribute [[html]] for expansions of abbreviations.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>This restriction does not apply to attributes that carry meta information (e.g., the
						[^global/class^] and [^a/href^] attributes [[html]], as well as the [^html-global/title^]
						attribute in <a href="#page-list">the page list</a>).</p>

					<div class="note">

					<div class="note">

				<h3>Authoring best practices</h3>

				<p>As this is a technical specification for the eBraille format, its focus is on the technologies for
					creating [=eBraille content documents=]. It does not specify a specific manner in which the content
					must be created, as regional differences in braille codes will influence how any given publication
					is formatted.</p>

				<p>A goal of the eBraille format, however, is, as much as possible, to promote common markup practices
					across regions so that organizations and individuals can interchange files without needing to
					completely reformat them. Using common markup practices will allow [=eBraille reading systems=] to
					apply regional CSS rules, improving the readability for users expecting different braille formatting
					conventions.</p>

				<p>To this end, eBraille content documents rely primarily on the [[html]] [^global/class^] and [^/role^]
					attributes to identify formatting requirements. Augmenting core HTML elements with a common set of
					classes and roles will make eBraille publications more predictable for reformatting.</p>

				<p>The eBraille working group is working on a set of best practices to help facilitate this model. These
					include:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="best-practices/tagging/">eBraille Tagging Best Practices</a> &#8212; This document

			<h2>Primary entry page</h2>

			<section id="navdoc-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>To make it easier to deploy [=eBraille publications=] on the web, the [=EPUB navigation document=] is
					used as the primary entry point for publications. The required file naming (<code>index.html</code>)
					and location of this file mean it will be the first document loaded when users browse to a folder
					containing an eBraille publication.</p>

				<p>By requiring the [=primary entry page=] be located in the [=publication root=], it is also easier for
					users to unzip an eBraille publication and read it locally, if they so choose. If all the other
					resources in the publication are placed in a subfolder, for example, the primary entry page will be
					the first HTML document users encounter in the unzipped folder.</p>

				<p>The primary entry page does not have to be the first document in the <a href="#spine">spine</a>,
					however. As the page is meant as an entryway for web reading, it may not be helpful to include it in
					the spine at all. Reading systems will still be able to extract the table of contents and other
					information from the document even if it is not in the spine.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="nav-req">
				<h3>General requirements</h3>

				<p>The primary entry page MUST be named <code>index.html</code>. This file has to be located in the
					[=publication root=], as defined in <a href="#fileset-structure"></a>.</p>

				<p>The primary entry page MUST be a conforming <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-nav">EPUB navigation
						document</a> [[epub-33]].</p>

				<p>As the primary entry page is meant to help browser users navigate the publication, it SHOULD NOT be
					included in the <a href="#spine">spine</a>. If the publication needs a table of contents in the
					spine, it is better to create a separate document with publication-specific formatting.</p>

				<p>As per the requirements of EPUB 3, the <a href="#manifest">manifest entry</a> for the primary entry
					page has to have a <code>properties</code> attribute with the value "<code>nav</code>"
					[[epub-33]].</p>

				<aside class="example" title="Manifest entry for the primary entry page">
					<pre><code>&lt;package &#8230;>

&lt;/package></code></pre>
				</aside>

				<p>The primary entry page MAY include [[html]] [^script^] elements only if the document is not included
					in the spine. This exception is to allow publishers to include a user interface to better enable
					reading of their publication in browsers. It is not meant for general scripting of the content.</p>

				<div class="note">
					<p>A scripted primary entry page is not allowed in the spine as an extra measure to ensure that the
						scripting does not interfere with rendering in [=eBraille reading systems=]. Reading systems are
						expected to disable the scripting in the primary entry page regardless of the document's
						placement in the spine.</p>

					<h4>Table of contents</h4>

					<p>The table of contents provides users access to the major sections of the publications.</p>

					<p>The EPUB 3 specification requires that the table of contents be defined in an [[html]] [^nav^]
						element whose <a data-cite="epub-33#dfn-epub-type"><code>epub:type</code> attribute</a>
						specifies the value "<a data-cite="epub-33#sec-nav-toc"><code>toc</code></a>" [[epub-33]].</p>

					<p>For compatibility with web-based rendering, the table of contents MUST also be identified by the
						[^/role^] attribute [[html]] value "<a data-cite="dpub-aria#doc-toc"><code>doc-toc</code></a>"
						[[dpub-aria]].</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Table of contents identified by the epub:type and role attributes">

      &lt;/nav>
   &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></code></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>The table of contents is defined by a single [[html]] ordered list ([^ol^]) in the root of the
							<code>nav</code> element. Each [[html]] list item ([^li^]) represents one of the top-level
						sections of the publication. If the section can be linked to, wrap its heading inside an
						[[html]] anchor tag ([^a^]), otherwise wrap the heading in a [^span^] element (unlinked headings
						are not common outside of publications that omit content).</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Table of contents for a novel with only chapter headings">
						<pre><code>&lt;nav epub:type="toc"
     role="doc-toc"

					<p>If a section contains additional subsections, list those headings in an <code>ol</code> element
						after the link to the heading.</p>

					</aside>

					<p>The minimalist rules on the structure of the table of contents are to ensure that [=eBraille

					</aside>

					<p>The page list is defined by a single [[html]] ordered list ([^ol^]) in the root of the

						links to its location.</p>

					<p>Each entry in the page list MUST include the print page number equivalent in a [^title^]

				<p>Although eBraille shares a common file set with EPUB 3, many of the <a
						data-cite="epub-33#sec-security-privacy">privacy and security threats</a> [[epub-33]] that arise
					with EPUB 3 publications do not apply to [=eBraille publications=]. The reason is that the primary

					the same risks from third party scripts, from attempts by publishers to monitor their activities or
					profile them through scripting, or from malicious code being brought in by remote resource calls,
					among other threats outlined in EPUB 3.</p>

				<p>It does not mean that there are no security or privacy risks with eBraille publications. [=eBraille
					creators=] still need to ensure they maintain the security and privacy rights of users when creating
					their publications. The possible areas of concern for eBraille publications include:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>Linking to external resources</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Linking out to resources on the web can expose users to potential malicious content.
							Broken-link hijacking is one example where a malicious actor may buy the expired domain of a
							site and redirect users to content the eBraille creator never intended. Links to a
							publishers web site could allow them to profile users if they include tracking
							information.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Including malicious content</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Although eBraille does not allow eBraille creators to embed remote resources in publications,
							using third-party resources, such as tactile graphics, can expose users to exploits.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>Falsified publication information</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Malicious actors could include false metadata &#8212; such as the title, author, and
							publisher &#8212; in an eBraille publication to trick unsuspecting users into believing they
							are reading material from a trustworthy source. This could lead users to be more trusting of
							external links than they otherwise would be.</p>

			<h2>eBraille Reading Systems</h2>

				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>As an [=eBraille publication=] represents a subset of an <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-epub-conf">EPUB 3
						publication</a> [[epub-33]], an eBraille reading system similarly consists of a subset of
					features of a full <a data-cite="epub-rs-33#sec-rs-conformance">EPUB 3 reading system</a>
					[[epub-rs-33]].</p>

				<p>Similar to EPUB 3, eBraille does not define a uniform set of requirements that all reading systems
					must meet. Support is instead based on the capabilities of the device. A reading system might not
					support <a href="#ebrl-mo">media overlays</a>, for example, if it does not support audio
					playback.</p>

				<p>As eBraille publications can be deployed unpackaged on the web, users may not even always require a
					dedicated eBraille reading system to read them. A very basic reading experience will be possible
					directly from a standard web browser, and browser-based reading systems can provide a richer reading
					experience for reading on the web.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="rs-req">
				<h3>Reading system requirements</h3>

				<p>An [=eBraille reading system=] MUST meet the <a data-cite="epub-rs-33#sec-rs-conformance"
						>requirements for EPUB reading systems</a> [[epub-rs-33]], with the following differences:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>It MUST NOT support <a data-cite="epub-rs-33#sec-epub-rs-conf-remote-res">remote resources</a>
						[[epub-rs-33]].</li>
					<li>It MUST NOT resolve [=path-absolute-URL strings=] [[url]].</li>
					<li>As remote resources, forms, and scripting are not supported, it MUST NOT allow [=eBraille
						publications=] to have <a data-cite="epub-rs-33#sec-epub-rs-network-access">network access</a>
						[[epub-rs-33]]. (Note that barring network access should not prevent users from following <a
							data-cite="epub-rs-33#sec-epub-rs-external-links">external hyperlinks</a> [[epub-rs-33]] in
						a publication.)</li>
					<li>It MUST NOT support <a data-cite="epub-rs-33#sec-pkg-doc-manifest">manifest fallbacks</a>
						[[epub-rs-33]].</li>
					<li>It MUST only support [=eBraille content documents=] in the <code>spine</code>. The reading
						system MAY reject eBraille publications with other formats in the spine or ignore their entries
						when rendering the publication.</li>
					<li>It MUST NOT support <a data-cite="epub-rs-33#sec-xhtml-forms">form submission</a>
						[[epub-rs-33]].</li>
					<li>It MUST NOT support <a data-cite="epub-rs-33#sec-svg">SVG content documents</a>. (Note that this
						does not affect <a data-cite="epub-rs-33#sec-xhtml-svg">embedded SVG</a> [[epub-rs-33]].)</li>
					<li>It MUST NOT support EPUB 3's <a data-cite="epub-33#sec-css-prefixed">prefixed CSS properties</a>
						[[epub-33]].</li>
					<li>It MUST NOT support <a data-cite="epub-rs-33#sec-scripted-content">scripting</a>
						[[epub-rs-33]].</li>
					<li>It is not required that eBraille publications be <a data-cite="epub-rs-33#sec-container-iri"
							>assigned a unique URL</a> [[epub-rs-33]], as scripting is not supported, but it is still
						recommended to domain isolate publications in case scripting is introduced in a future
						version.</li>
					<li>It MUST NOT support <a data-cite="epub-rs-33#epub-rs-33/#sec-rendering-control">fixed
							layouts</a> [[epub-rs-33]].</li>
					<li>It MUST NOT support <a data-cite="epub-rs-33#sec-epub-rs-conf-backward">backward

							compatibility</a> with other EPUB versions [[epub-rs-33]].</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In addition, eBraille reading systems MUST support PDF for tactile graphics. If an eBraille reading
					system is not capable of rendering PDFs embedded in [=eBraille content documents=], it MUST provide
					a mechanism that allows the user to open the graphics in an application that supports PDF
					rendering.</p>

				<p>If an eBraille reading system supports web access, it SHOULD allow users to download unpackaged
					eBraille publications hosted on the web by specifying the path to the package document.</p>
